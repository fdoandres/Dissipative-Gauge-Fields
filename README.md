## ðŸŒŒ Project Overview

This repository accompanies the preprint:  
**"Dissipative Gauge Fields: A Thermodynamic Unification of Fundamental Interactions"**

The work proposes a novel unification framework where **gauge fields and the Higgs boson are reinterpreted as dissipative structures** governed by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  
Through the introduction of an **irreversibility tensor** into the quantum field Lagrangian, this approach connects **particle physics, cosmology, and thermodynamics without exotic particles.**

### Core Contributions:
- Explains galactic rotation curves without dark matter.
- Resolves black hole singularities via Higgs field regularization.
- Dynamically generates dark energy from Higgs field fluctuations.
- Predicts gravitational wave signatures and X-ray excesses.

This model represents a **paradigm shift beyond Î›CDM**, offering falsifiable predictions with current and next-generation observatories such as XRISM, Athena, LISA, Euclid, and DESI.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Predictions

- **X-ray excess (15â€“25%)** in galactic halos, verifiable with XRISM and Athena.
- **30% gravitational wave suppression** in post-merger quasi-normal modes, detectable with LISA (SNR > 15).
- **Mild evolution of dark energy density**, distinguishable from Î›CDM using Euclid and DESI data.
- **Regularization of black hole singularities** through Higgs field decay.
